### PI: Claudia Sol&iacute;s-Lemus

I am an associate professor at the [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/) and the [Department of Plant Pathology](https://plantpath.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). Originally from Mexico City, I did my Undergraduate degrees
in Actuarial Sciences and Applied Mathematics at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en).
Then, I did a MA in [Mathematics](http://www.math.wisc.edu) and a PhD in [Statistics](http://www.stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, running, biking, climbing and yoga!
