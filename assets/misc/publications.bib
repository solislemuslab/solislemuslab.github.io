  abstract = "When grown on agar surfaces, microbes can produce distinct
              multicellular spatial structures called colonies, which contain
              characteristic sizes, shapes, edges, textures, and degrees of
              opacity and color. For over one hundred years, researchers have
              used these morphology cues to classify bacteria and guide more
              targeted treatment of pathogens. Advances in genome sequencing
              technology have revolutionized our ability to classify bacterial
              isolates and while genomic methods are in the ascendancy,
              morphological characterization of bacterial species has made a
              resurgence due to increased computing capacities and widespread
              application of machine learning tools. In this paper, we revisit
              the topic of colony morphotype on the within-species scale and
              apply concepts from image processing, computer vision, and deep
              learning to a dataset of 69 environmental and clinical
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. We find that colony morphology
              and complexity under common laboratory conditions is a robust,
              repeatable phenotype on the level of individual strains, and
              therefore forms a potential basis for strain classification. We
              then use a deep convolutional neural network approach with a
              combination of data augmentation and transfer learning to
              overcome the typical data starvation problem in biological
              applications of deep learning. Using a train/validation/test
              split, our results achieve an average validation accuracy of
              92.9\% and an average test accuracy of 90.7\% for the
              classification of individual strains. These results indicate that
              bacterial strains have characteristic visual 'fingerprints' that
              can serve as the basis of classification on a sub-species level.
              Our work illustrates the potential of image-based classification
              of bacterial pathogens and highlights the potential to use
              similar approaches to predict medically relevant strain
              characteristics like antibiotic resistance and virulence from
              colony data.",

                   to understand how the biodiversity that we see on Earth
                   evolved from single-cell organisms at the origin of life and
                   this diversification process is represented through the Tree
                   of Life. Low sampling rates and high heterogeneity in the
                   rate of evolution across sites and lineages produce a
                   phenomenon denoted ``long branch attraction'' (LBA) in which
                   long non-sister lineages are estimated to be sisters
                   regardless of their true evolutionary relationship. LBA has
                   been a pervasive problem in phylogenetic inference affecting
                   different types of methodologies from distance-based to
                   likelihood-based. Here, we present a novel neural network
                   model that outperforms standard phylogenetic methods and
                   other neural network implementations under LBA settings.
                   Furthermore, unlike existing neural network models, our
                   model naturally accounts for the tree isomorphisms via
                   permutation invariant functions which ultimately result in
                   lower memory and allows the seamless extension to larger

                   machine learning, successfully identifying clustering
                   patterns in data across a broad range of domain
                   applications. Surprisingly, despite its accuracy and elegant
                   simplicity, unsupervised learning has not been sufficiently
                   exploited in the realm of phylogenetic tree inference. The
                   main reason for the delay in adoption of unsupervised
                   learning in phylogenetics is the lack of a meaningful, yet
                   simple, way of embedding phylogenetic trees into a vector
                   space. Here, we propose the simple yet powerful split-weight
                   embedding which allows us to fit standard clustering
                   algorithms to the space of phylogenetic trees. We show that

              $\gamma$ $\in$ (0, 1) for the inheritance probability of the
